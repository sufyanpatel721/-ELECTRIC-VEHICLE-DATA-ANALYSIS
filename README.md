# ELECTRIC-VEHICLE-DATA-ANALYSIS

As a Tableau learner, I embarked on a fascinating journey into the world of data analysis, using a topic close to my heart - Electric Vehicle (EV) Data Analysis. This project represents my efforts to explore the capabilities of Tableau and its potential in transforming raw data into insightful visualizations.

## Description

In today's rapidly changing world, the transition to electric vehicles has become more critical than ever. This project delves into the world of EV data, with a focus on gaining insights into electric vehicle adoption, performance, and eligibility for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) incentives.

By diving into this dataset, I aim to answer key questions that interest both me as a learner and anyone passionate about electric vehicles:

- How many electric vehicles are registered in different regions and states?
- What are the trends in electric vehicle adoption over the years?
- Which makes and models are most popular among EV owners?
- What is the eligibility status for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle incentives?

## Features

During this project, I've harnessed the power of Tableau to create visual representations of the data, including:

- A map chart showcasing the number of EVs by state.
- A bar chart depicting the number of EVs registered by model year.
- A pie chart illustrating vehicle eligibility for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle incentives.
- A customizable bar chart that allows you to explore the top N vehicles by make and vehicle type.
